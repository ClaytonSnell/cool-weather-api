## Description

I struggled with this one a lot. I slacked off at the start of class and it was very hard for me to go back and revisit this assignment even when I started grasping concepts tought further along in this class. For months I had an API key, but because I didnt pay enough attention, I didn't realize I had to put in card info/take the basic plan to get the one we were supposed to work with to work. I re-visitied the tape and used help from another student to get this finally turned in. I plan on going back through every assignment in this class and focusing on the basic funtions. It's crazy to see that I know more about backend framework and the items taught further along in this class than I do the basics. With a tiny bit of time I could expand on this code. But it is crunch time.
